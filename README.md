# @Tubular Browser Check

## (The Art of Giving Up Gracefully)

As a web developer you likely know the pain of wanting to use flashy new web browser features, but feeling like you have to hold back until very few users will be inconvenienced by any browser incompatibilities that might arise from using the latest and greatest features that browsers have to offer.

Fortunately these days, a majority of web users have switched to ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù browsers which frequently self-update, allowing you to employ new features of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with reasonable confidence.

There are still, however, even at the time I‚Äôm writing this documentation (May 2022), people clinging to Windows 7. There are users with old desktops and mobile devices with limited capacity for updates and upgrades. Ideally, instead of leaving such users out in the cold, you selectively downgrade the capabilities of your websites a little, still providing most of the desired experience on older browsers &mdash; perhaps a little less stylishly, without all the bells and whistles.

There are times, however, when only relatively up-to-date web browsers will do. There need to be some cut-off points, below which you have to say to your users (much more diplomatically, of course) they are üí© out of luck trying to get by with an older web browser.

Preferably this message of misfortune will be conveyed gracefully, not left to the user to deduce by way of frozen screens, confusing error messages, endlessly spinning spinners, jumbled page layouts, and other assorted technical failures. A polite, friendly, human-readable message explaining the problem, and perhaps even how to remedy the issue, is a much better way to go.

This is where **@tubular/browser-check** comes in.

This is a script written in lowest-common-denominator JavaScript (requiring nothing that cannot be done under the ancient standard of ES3) for assessing what a web browser is or is not capable of, providing an opportunity to redirect to an incompatibility message page when needed.

Using **@tubular/browser-check**, you can specify a minimum ES level (6/2015, 2016, 2017, etc.), particular features required (such as grid layout or WebGL), and/or minimum version numbers for popular web browsers. You can also rule out some web browsers (such as Internet Explorer and pre-Chromium Legacy Edge) entirely.

## Installation/Use

**@tubular/browser-check** should be invoked via a `<script>` tag, before any other possibly incompatible JavaScript has a chance to run. This likely means being the first, or close to the first, script in the `<head>` section of a web page.

### Using npm

```
npm i -D @tubular/browser-check
```

Since this code is meant to run as a pre-check process, and not to be a bundled part of a web application itself, it makes the most sense to install it under `devDependencies`, not `dependencies`, then copy either `browser-check.js` or `browser-check.min.js` from `node_modules` as part of your build process. For example, here is how I‚Äôm using the script in an Angular project, as seen in a snippet from my `angular.json` file:

```json5
{
  // ...
            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets",
              {
                "glob": "browser-check.min.js*",
                "input": "./node_modules/@tubular/browser-check/dist/",
                "output": "./assets/"
              }
            ],
  // ...
}
```

The script is pulled into the `<head>` section of the project‚Äôs `index.html` like this:

```html
  <script src="assets/browser-check.min.js" type="text/javascript"
          data-bc-vers="0,79,79,13.1,605" data-bc-min-es="2017"
          data-bc-fail-url="assets/incompatible.html"></script>
```

### Using via unpkg.com

```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@tubular/browser-check/dist/browser-check.min.js" type="text/javascript"
          data-bc-vers="0,79,79,13.1,605" data-bc-min-es="2017"
          data-bc-fail-url="assets/incompatible.html"></script>
```

As always, the unpkg.com URL can include a specific npm package version if desired.

### Internet Explorer issue

Older versions of IE can be buggy handling `<base href=...`> tags. As a result, it‚Äôs possible either the loading of this script, or the loading of your redirect page, might fail. The following code, placed after the `<base>` tag, and before the `<script>` tag, can fix that issue:

```
  <!--[if IE]><script type="text/javascript">
    (function() { // Fix for IE ignoring relative base tags.
        var baseTag = document.getElementsByTagName('base')[0];
        baseTag.href = baseTag.href + '';
    })();
  </script><![endif]-->
```

## Options

Options are passed to **@tubular/browser-check** via various `data-bc-` attributes of the `<script>` tag.

### `data-bc-fail-url`

This is the URL to which the user will be forwarded if the browser check fails. If this setting is omitted, **@tubular/browser-check** merely gathers information about a browser without taking any action.

In the event of a failed browser check, this URL will be appended with the parameter `msg`, containing a URL-encoded explanation of the reason why the browser check failed.

### `data-bc-min-es`

This is the minimum acceptable ES compliance level. Nothing earlier than ES3 will be reported or detected. *(Very few browsers should rate lower than ES2009 (ES5) these days.)*

When set to a specific ES version (for example, `2018`), **@tubular/browser-check** will stop checking for higher ES levels as soon as 2018 compliance is determined (although individual higher-level features can still be checked). If `data-bc-min-es` is set to `0`, no ES level checking will be performed. If `data-bc-min-es` is set to `-1`, **@tubular/browser-check** will seek the highest level of support.

Not every ES feature is tested, of course, only a representative sample sufficient to determine the level of support with reasonable certainty.

### `data-bc-vers`

You can set this attribute to a comma-delimited list of minimum-supported browser version numbers, with the list of numbers being in this fixed order:

* Internet Explorer
* Legacy (pre-Chromium) Windows Edge
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* A minimum AppleWebKit version number for otherwise-unclassified non-Android, non-Linux browsers which specify an AppleWebKit version (quite likely running on iOS, using the same rendering engine as Safari).

You can use 0 as the version number for any browser you wish to completely disallow, and -1 for any browser you do not wish to check at all. (Any unspecified versions are treated as -1). Version numbers are treated as integers except for Safari version numbers, which can include a minor version number in X.Y form, such as 13.1.

Ideally you can test for browser support without identifying particular browsers, using ES level and other feature checks alone. But sometimes particular browser quirks and bugs must be considered.

I fully support, for example, `data-bc-vers="0,0"` as a common starting point, completely giving up on supporting Internet Explorer and all of the pre-Chromium versions of Microsoft‚Äôs Edge browser.

Many browsers, such as Opera, Samsung, and the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, are based on the same Chromium core engine as Google Chrome. These browsers are treated as variants of Chrome, and their Chrome version is what will matter, not their various browser-specific version numbers.

> Please note: **@tubular/browser-check** does not employ a highly sophisticated browser identification system. Browser identification is an inexact science. The most accurate identification systems are much bigger and more elaborate than the quick-and-dirty classification scheme provided here. You might need to employ other means in addition to, or instead of, **@tubular/browser-check** if your needs for browser identification are more demanding.

### `data-bc-globals`

Set this attribute to `true` (or simply add the attribute as a flag attribute with no value at all) if you would like to have **@tubular/browser-check** save its results in the global variable `window.tb_bc_info`. The information provided is, for example, as follows:

```json5
{
  browser: "Chrome", // Name or description of browser, possibly "Unrecognized"
  version: 101, // Browser version, if determined
  es: 2021, // ES specification passed. 0 if never checked, minimum value of 3 if checked
  otherFeatures: "audio, av_input... workers", // Any tests successfully passed beyond the ES level check tests.
  msg: "" // If any tests have failed, the message describing that failure.
}
```
